Simple Slab memory allocator originally designed for [[https://github.com/slamko/slavOS][my hobby OS]] and extensively tested on it.

In normal circumstances runs nearly as fast as malloc
(with the restriction of course of allocating memory blocks with predefined size).

Supposingly should perform better for allocating big object in long running application with fragmented heap, as it uses malloc only for allocating slab caches.
